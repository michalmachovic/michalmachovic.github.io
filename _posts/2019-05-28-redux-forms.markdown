<h2>Redux Forms</h2>
`github.com/erikras/redux-form/releases`
<br /><br />
As of March 22 2019, the maintainer of Redux Form seems to have accidentally rolled back to an extremely out of date version. To work around this, we need to install a specific version which is the latest known good release.
<br />
`npm install redux-form@8.1.0`

<br /><br />
Documentation is at:
`redux-form.com`

<br /><br />
