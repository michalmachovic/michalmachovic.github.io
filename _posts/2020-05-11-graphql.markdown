<h2>What is GraphQL ? </h2>
- query language
- usually we have one single endpoint (typically /graphql) <br />
- uses POST because request body defines Data Structure of retrieved Data, so we are using POST for getting data <br />
- server-side resolver analyses Request body, Fetches and Prepares and Returns Data <br />
<br /><br />


<h2>Why is it better than REST Api for some scenarios ? </h2>
- lets presume you have data of posts, which have `id`, `title` and `content`<br />
- imagine situation where you want to retrieve `id` and `title` in one page and `content` on another page<br />
- you can do two different endpoints or one endpoint loaded with query url<br />
- both solutions arent very good or effective<br />
- in GraphQL you can define on frontend, which data you want to retrieve from backend<br />
