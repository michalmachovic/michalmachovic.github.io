<br /><br />
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser.
<br /><br />
Following example will read file content of `data.json` file and convert it into object. `__dirname` is root folder of your project.
<br /><br />


{% highlight javascript %}
//index.js
const fs = require('fs'); //filesystem module

const json = fs.readFileSync(`${__dirname}/data/data.json`, 'utf-8');
const laptopData = JSON.parse(json);

console.log(laptopData);
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight javascript %}
//data/data.json

        "description": "The Huawei MateBook X Pro is our pick for the best laptop money can buy in 2018. This is a gorgeously-designed laptop with a stunning screen (albeit with a rather odd aspect ratio), and it comes packed with cutting edge components that allows it to perform brilliantly, and a battery life that runs rings around many of its rivals. It also has a very competitive price, giving you features, design and performance for quite a bit less money."
