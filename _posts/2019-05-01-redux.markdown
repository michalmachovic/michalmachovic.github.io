<h2>What is Redux ? </h2>
- state management library <br />
- makes creating complex applications easier <br />
- not required to create a React app <br />
- not explicitly designed to work with React <br />

<br /><br />

<h2>Redux Cycle</h2>
- Action Creator <br />
- Action <br />
- dispatch <br />
- Reducers <br />
- State <br />

<br /><br />
We will do an example, a model of insurance company.
<br />
`policy` - customer holds a policy, if bad stuff happends to them then we pay them<br />
`claim` - customer had something bad happen to them, we need to pay them

<br /><br />
Customer will bring to our company new `Form`. There is `Form receiver`, which will pass the form to correct department `Claims History`, `Policies` or `Accounting`.
<br /><br />
Each 'Form' is an object, which has `Type` and `Payload`.
`type` - name, `claim` or `policy`<br />
`payload` - contains name of customer and value
<br /><br/ >
We will have 3 types of form <br />
`Create Policy` <br />
`Create Claim` <br />
`Delete Policy` <br />
